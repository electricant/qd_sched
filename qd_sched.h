/*
 * Quick and Dirty Scheduler for repetitive tasks
 * 
 * This is a cooperative multitasking arliest deadline first (EDF)scheduler.
 * As the name says, the scheduler is very basic: it keeps track of the last run time of each task and,
 * if current_millis - last_run_time is greater than or equal to the time interval between task runs,
 * then the selected task is run. If no task has to be run the it sleeps until the next iteration.
 * Therefore, each task function is executed periodically every rate milliseconds.
 * 
 * There is no priority support for tasks. For maximum timing accuracy, the tasks are ordered
 * (and therefore scanned to choose the next to run) by increasing rate.
 *
 * NOTE: this scheduler hijacks your loop() function defining its own.
